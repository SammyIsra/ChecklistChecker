# Checklist Checker
A tiny Node CLI tool to make sure you don't forget anything. Slightly glorified todo checklist.

Still under construction, it's my first time doing Node CLI tooling.

## How to use
```
>checklist create
```
To create a new checklist! It then asks you to for items to add to che checklist.

```
>checklist check [fileName]
```
Check the checklist on file `fileName` (or `checklist.json)` by default.
