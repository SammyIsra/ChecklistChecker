# PreFly List Checker üìù
A tiny Node CLI tool to make sure you don't forget anything. Slightly glorified todo checklist.

Still under construction, it's my first time doing Node CLI tooling :wrench:

Here's a simple sample:

## How to use
```
$ prefly create [fileName]
```
To create a new checklist! It then asks you to for items to add to the checklist. After creating a checklist from the console, your checklist would look like this:

If you want, you can write the checklist yourself and you can make it look like so:

Once you have a checklist, you can check it like so:
```
$ prefly check [fileName]
```
To check the checklist on file `fileName` (or `checklist.json`) by default.

This is still under construction and forever considering improvements to it. 

:dizzy: Enjoy!
